`r` is the index of each corresponding cell of `y` in the intervals defined by the major cells of `x`, which is assumed to be sorted: cells of `y` before all cells of `x` are labeled `0`, cells of `y` between the first cell and the second cell of `x` are labeled `1`, ..., cells of `y` after all cells of `x` are labeled `≢x`.
