`x` is a scalar integer, vector of integers or matrix. `r` is the result of applying `F` to *infixes* of `y` as defined by `x`:

* if `x` is a positive scalar, it is interpreted as `⟨x⋄1⟩`;
* if `x` is a negative scalar, it is interpreted as `⟨|x⋄|x⟩`;
* if `x` is a vector, it is interpreted as `∧x`;

Each row of `x` corresponds to an axis of `y` and defines the windowing along that axis. In its most general form, each row of `x` is of the form `⟨size⋄skip⋄mode⟩⍪args`. `skip` defaults to `1`; `mode` defaults to `1`; `args` defaults to `⟨⟩`.

## Modes

Each `mode` is a way of handling creating windows at edges of the array.

### `1`: Keep Shorter at End; args = `⟨⟩`

The first window starts at `0`; the next window at `skip`; and so on. All windows have length `size`, except the last one which might be shorter if the array ends.

### `¯1`: Keep Shorter at Beginning; args = `⟨⟩`

The last window ends at the end of the array `¯1+≢y`; the second-to-last window at `(¯1+≢y)-skip`; and so on. All windows have length `size`, except the first one which might be shorter if the array ends.

### `2`: Drop Shorter at End; args = `⟨⟩`

Like mode `1`, except that if the last window is shorter it is excluded.

### `¯2`: Drop Shorter at Beginning; args = `⟨⟩`

Like mode `¯1`, except that if the first window is shorter it is excluded.

### `3`: Transform at End; args = `⟨fill⟩⍪params`

Like mode `1`, except that if the last window is shorter, it is padded using fill mode `fill` with params `params`.

### `¯3`: Transform at Beginning; args = `⟨fill⟩⍪params`

Like mode `¯1`, except that if the first window is shorter, it is padded using fill mode `fill` with params `params`.

### `4`: Stencil; args = `⟨fill⟩⍪params`

The first window starts such that the first element is in the middle, if `size` is odd, or the first two elements are in the middle, if `size` is even; and continues until the last element or tow eleemnts are reached at or past the middle.

### `5`: Continue at End; args = `⟨fill⟩⍪params`

Like mode `3`, except that it doesn't stop when the last window encounters the last item of the array anywhere, but only at the beginning.

### `¯5`: Continue at Beginning; args = `⟨fill⟩⍪params`

Like mode `¯3`, except that it doesn't stop where the first window encounters the first item of the array anywhere, but only at the end.

## Fill modes

Fill modes are behaviors for when you need to generate new array elements to fill a window.

### `0`: Fill; params = `⟨el⟩`

All extra elements are `el`.

### `1`: Replicate; params = `⟨⟩`

If extending the end of the array, the last item is used; if extending the beginning of the array, the first item is used.

### `2`: Reverse; params = `⟨⟩`

Both edges are extended by selecting items of the array in reverse order.

### `3`: Mirror, params = `⟨⟩`

If extending the end of the array, items of the init of the array in reverse order are used; if extending the beginning of the array, items of the tail of the list in reverse order are used.

### `4`: Wrap, params = `⟨⟩`

Both edges are extended by selecting items of the array.

### `⊏Fn`: Custom, params = `⟨⟩`

`Fn` is called with the array as right argument and the required amount of extra elements as the left argument.
