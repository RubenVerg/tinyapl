`x` must be a vector of integers. Either all elements are natural, or exactly one of them is `¯1` and all others are natural.

`r` is the elements of `y` reshaped to the shape defined by `x`:

* if `×⍆x` is equal to `×⍆⍴y`, the elements of `y` are simply reordered to fit the new shape `x`
* if `×⍆x` is positive and less than `×⍆⍴y`, elements of `y` are dropped from the end to fit the new shape
* if `×⍆x` is greater than `×⍆⍴y`, elements of `y` are repeated cyclically to fit the new shape
* if `¯1∊x`, the product of all elements of `x` that are not `¯1` must be a divisor of the amount of elements of `y`, and the resulting shape is obtained by substituting `(×⍆⍴y)÷×⍆x⌿⍨¯1≠x` for the `¯1` in `x`.

Fails if `y` is empty and `x` describes a nonempty shape.
