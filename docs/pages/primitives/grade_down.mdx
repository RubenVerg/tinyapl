If `y` is an array, `r` is the indices that would sort the major cells of `y` in descending order according to [total array ordering](/info/ordering). Grading is stable, that is, the indices of two cells that are equal appear in `r` in the same order as the cells themselves.

If `y` is a dictionary, `r` is the keys that would sort the values in descending order.
